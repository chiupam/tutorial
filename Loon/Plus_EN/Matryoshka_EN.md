# Nesting between strategy groups

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Regardless of the three agent software `Surge` `Quantumult X` `Loon`, they are all on the issue of the strategy group It’s the `Russian doll` to achieve layered packaging

## Correct nesting demonstration

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) This tutorial only allows users to nest between policy groups and policy groups, if you want Loon to use nodes in the sub-policy group , The parent policy group and the child policy group need to be nested correctly. The two correct examples are as follows:

-Subscription Rules >>> Parent Policy Group >>> Child Policy Group >>> Subscription Node/Filter Subscription Node

-Subscription rules >>> parent policy group >>> child policy group >>> secondary child policy group >>> subscription node/filter subscription node

## Step

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) If you want the `manual selection` policy group to be nested under the `Proxy` policy group, that is, `Proxy` >>> `Manual selection`, if the user has not created a `Proxy` policy group, please click [here](https://github.com/chiupam/tutorial/blob/master/Loon/Plus/New_Proxy_Group_EN.md) to jump to `New Strategy Group` Tutorial

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Open Loon and click the `Configuration` column below, and click `Strategy Group`

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) In the nesting between policy groups, `policy type` only allows to select `select`, confirm the right of `policy type` Is `select`, otherwise please modify this option

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) From the list of `strategy groups`, click on the `manual selection` strategy group
